Here, we present a summary of the idea of the program. For more details, refer to the published article.\hypertarget{index_analogs}{}\doxysubsection{Nucleic Acid Analogs}\label{index_analogs}
In the context of this program, Nucleic Acid Analogs refer to nucleic acids with any modifications in the nucleobase or the backbone. Additionally, the program can build hexameric nucleic acid analogs. The following image shows a few example of nucleic acid analogs that can be constructed by the program.

Panel (b) shows the canonical nucleobases and two examples of alternative nucleobases that can be incorporated into a nucleic acid duplex. Panel (c) shows the interaction between three adenine oligomers and an alternative nucleobase. Panel (d) shows the interaction between oligomers of two alternative nucleobases and the formation of a hexmeric structure.
