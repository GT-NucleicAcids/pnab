\hypertarget{trying_and_installing_trying}{}\doxysubsection{Trying the Program Online}\label{trying_and_installing_trying}
You can explore the program online by clicking \href{https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/alenaizan/pnab/master?urlpath=\%2Fapps\%2Fbinder/driver.ipynb}{\texttt{ here}}. This link takes you to the graphical user interface of the program. There, you can try various available examples for building D\+NA, R\+NA, and other alternative nucleic acids. You can also explore how the structure and energy of nucleic acids change as you play with the helical parameters. Additionally, you can upload a three-\/dimensional structure of an alternative nucleic acid backbone or nucleobase construct a new nucleic acid analogs. See the \mbox{\hyperlink{examples}{Examples}} section to learn how to use the grahpical interface.

This online version is useful for testing the program. The online version uses free cloud computing resources provided by \href{https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html}{\texttt{ Binder}}, and this comes with several limitations. If your session remains inactive for 10-\/20 minutes, your session will be terminated. Moreover, the cloud computers limit how long you can remain in a session. To prevent the loss of data when the session terminates because of inactivity, the program automatically download the output files after it finishes running. You may need to adjust the settings of the browser to allow pop-\/up windows to open for downloading.

If you need a more permanent version of the program, you can install it in your computer.\hypertarget{trying_and_installing_installation}{}\doxysubsection{Installation}\label{trying_and_installing_installation}
The p\+N\+AB program is available as a conda package. Download the light-\/weight \href{https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html}{\texttt{ miniconda}} or the more fully featured \href{https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/}{\texttt{ Anaconda}}. Open the conda terminal and type\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{conda create -\/n pnab -\/c alenaizan -\/c conda-\/forge pnab}
\DoxyCodeLine{conda activate pnab}
\end{DoxyCode}
 This creates and activates a new conda environment called {\ttfamily pnab}.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
You may need to activate the N\+G\+L\+View library to visualize molecules\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{jupyter-\/nbextension enable nglview -\/-\/py -\/-\/sys-\/prefix}
\end{DoxyCode}


In Windows, the program may not compute energires correctly if the environment variable B\+A\+B\+E\+L\+\_\+\+D\+A\+T\+A\+D\+IR is not set. Set the variable to the
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{share\(\backslash\)openbabel }
\end{DoxyCode}
 folder inside your Miniconda/\+Anaconda folder.
\end{DoxyNote}
\hypertarget{trying_and_installing_running}{}\doxysubsection{Running the Program}\label{trying_and_installing_running}
The program can be used through a graphical user interface or a simple python script.\hypertarget{trying_and_installing_GUI}{}\doxysubsubsection{Using the Graphical User Interface}\label{trying_and_installing_GUI}
From the conda command-\/line, run\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{jupyter notebook}
\end{DoxyCode}


Alternatively, open {\itshape Anaconda} {\itshape Navigator} (\href{https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/getting-started/}{\texttt{ details}})\+:   
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight/2,keepaspectratio=true]{navigator.png}
\doxyfigcaption{Anaconda Navigator}
\end{DoxyImage}
 In the Jupyter Notebook tab, click on {\itshape Launch}. If a browser does not open automatically, you may need to open it this way\+:

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight/2,keepaspectratio=true]{navigator2.png}
\doxyfigcaption{Launching Jupyter Notebook}
\end{DoxyImage}


When a browser opens with the Jupyter page, it displays the folders in your computer. navigate to an appropriate folder or create a new folder if needed, then click on {\itshape New} $>$ {\itshape python} {\itshape 3}   
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight/2,keepaspectratio=true]{jupyter.png}

\end{DoxyImage}


This opens an empty notebook. Type the the following two lines in the first cell and run it. This should show the graphical user interface of the program. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{import} pnab}
\DoxyCodeLine{pnab.builder()}
\end{DoxyCode}

\doxyfigcaption{Running the Graphical User Interface}
\end{DoxyImage}
\hypertarget{trying_and_installing_script}{}\doxysubsubsection{Using a Python Script}\label{trying_and_installing_script}
The following python script would run the program to generate an R\+NA structure. The file {\itshape R\+N\+A.\+yaml} is an example file available in the program. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{import} pnab}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{run = pnab.pNAB(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"RNA.yaml"})}
\DoxyCodeLine{run.run()}
\end{DoxyCode}


To create your own input files, you can use the installed grahpical user interface or the online version. Alternatively, you can write an input file using a text editor and run it. See the \mbox{\hyperlink{examples}{Examples}} section to learn the content of the input files.
